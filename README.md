# PEEV ‚Äî Profit & Expense Evaluator for Vendors

PEEV is a full-featured team-based inventory and sales tracking web application built with React and Firebase, designed specifically for vending machine operations. This system helps vending machine operators track purchases, manage inventory across multiple locations, monitor expiration dates, and analyze profitability on a per-unit basis.

*Forked and transformed from P.I.T.A. (Panda's Integrated Tracking Assistant) to serve vending machine businesses.*

## Documentation

- **Project Plan & Architecture**: [`documentation/project-plan.md`](./documentation/project-plan.md)
- **Environment Setup Guide**: [`SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) - **Firebase Admin SDK, Resend, and Vercel configuration**
- **Legacy Documentation**: [`documentation/legacy-project-plan.md`](./documentation/legacy-project-plan.md)

## Enhanced Data Model (Team-Based Firestore)

All collections now use `teamId` for data isolation instead of `ownerUid`:

### Core Collections
- **`teams`**: name, ownerUid, members (array), createdAt
- **`users`**: email, displayName, teamId, joinedAt
- **`productCategories`**: name, teamId
- **`products`**: name, categoryId, sku?, description?, unitSize?, packSize?, teamId

### Enhanced Inventory System
```javascript
inventory: {
  productId: string,
  purchaseDate: date,           // When you bought it at the store
  totalCost: number,           // Total purchase cost (in cents)
  supplier: string?,           // Store name (Costco, Sam's Club, etc.)
  purchaseQuantity: number,    // Packs purchased (e.g., 1)
  unitsPerPack: number,        // Sellable units per pack (e.g., 24)
  initialQuantity: number,     // Total sellable units (auto-calculated)
  currentStock: number,        // Current sellable units available
  expirationDate: date?,       // Product expiration date
  location: string?,           // Vending machine location
  teamId: string
}
```

### Sales & Transactions
- **`transactions`**: saleDate, customerName?, subtotal, tax?, discount?, total, teamId
- **`saleItems`**: transactionId, inventoryId, quantitySold, pricePerItem, lineTotal, teamId
- **`sales`** (legacy): preserved for backward compatibility

### COGS Calculation (Updated)
**Per-Unit Cost Model:**
```javascript
unitCost = totalCost √∑ (purchaseQuantity √ó unitsPerPack)
// Example: $24.00 √∑ (1 √ó 24) = $1.00 per can
itemCOGS = unitCost √ó quantitySold
```

## Security Model

**Team-based access control** with Firestore security rules:
- All operations require authentication (`request.auth != null`)
- Data access restricted by team membership (`request.auth.uid in get(...).data.members`)
- Team owners can manage membership
- All members have equal data access privileges

## Vending Machine Workflows

### üì¶ **Receive Inventory**
1. Select product (e.g., "Coke Zero 12oz")
2. Purchase date auto-filled (today)
3. Enter total cost ($24.00)
4. Enter store (Costco)
5. Enter packs purchased (1)
6. Enter units per pack (24)
7. Set expiration date (optional)
8. Set location (Building A vending machine)

**Result**: 24 sellable units at $1.00 per unit cost

### üíµ **Record Sales**
1. Select product and inventory batch
2. Choose quantity sold (1 can)
3. Enter sale price ($1.50)
4. Record transaction

**Result**: $1.50 revenue, $1.00 COGS, $0.50 gross profit

### üìä **Track Performance**
- **Dashboard**: Real-time revenue, COGS, and profit metrics
- **Reports**: Monthly product performance and quarterly summaries
- **Inventory Alerts**: Visual warnings for expiring products

## Local Development

### 1. Environment Setup

VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-ABCDEF123 # optional
```

### 2. Install & Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run preview    # Preview build locally
```

### 3. Firebase Setup
- Create a new Firebase project
- Enable Authentication ‚Üí Google Sign-In
- Create Firestore database
- Deploy security rules from `firestore-security-rules.txt`
- Add your domain to Firebase Auth authorized domains

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. **Environment Variables**: Add all Firebase config vars to Vercel project settings
3. **Build Settings**:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
4. **Domain Setup**: Add Vercel domain to Firebase Auth authorized domains

The `vercel.json` includes SPA routing and security headers.
