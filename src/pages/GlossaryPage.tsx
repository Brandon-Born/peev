	// Financial Terms
	{
		term: 'COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)',
		definition: 'The direct costs of acquiring or producing the goods that were actually sold during a specific period. This only includes items that were sold, not items still in inventory.',
		example: 'If you bought a pallet for $1,000 with 100 items, and sold 20 items, your COGS would be $200 (20 items Ã— $10 per item).',
		formula: 'COGS = Weighted Average Cost Ã— Quantity Sold',
		category: 'Financial'
	},
	{
		term: 'Revenue',
		definition: 'The total amount of money received from sales before deducting any costs or expenses. Also called "gross sales" or "turnover".',

		formula: 'Revenue = Price Per Item Ã— Quantity Sold',
		category: 'Financial'
	},
	{
		term: 'Gross Profit',
		definition: 'The profit made after deducting the cost of goods sold from revenue. This shows how much money you made from sales before operating expenses.',

		formula: 'Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS',
		category: 'Financial'
	},
	{
		term: 'Gross Margin',
		definition: 'Gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue. This shows what percentage of each sale dollar becomes profit after covering the cost of goods.',
		example: 'A gross profit of $300 on revenue of $500 gives a gross margin of 60%.',
		formula: 'Gross Margin = (Gross Profit Ã· Revenue) Ã— 100',
		category: 'Financial'
	},
	{
		term: 'P&L (Profit & Loss)',
		definition: 'A financial statement showing revenue, costs, and profit over a specific period. In PEEV, this focuses on vending machine gross profit calculations.',
		example: 'Monthly P&L: Revenue $2,000 - COGS $800 = Gross Profit $1,200 (60% margin).',
		category: 'Financial'
	},

	// Inventory Terms
	{
		term: 'Shipment',
		definition: 'A bulk purchase of liquidated inventory, typically a pallet or lot of mixed products. Each shipment has a total cost and purchase date.',

		category: 'Inventory'
	},
	{
		term: 'Inventory Item',
		definition: 'Specific stock of a product from a particular shipment. Tracks how many units you received and how many remain in stock.',
		example: '50 iPhone cases from August Electronics Pallet, with 23 currently in stock.',
		category: 'Inventory'
	},
	{
		term: 'Initial Quantity',
		definition: 'The number of units of a product you received when you first added it to inventory from a shipment.',
		example: 'You received 50 iPhone cases in your electronics shipment.',
		category: 'Inventory'
	},
	{
		term: 'Current Stock',
		definition: 'The number of units currently available for sale. This decreases each time you make a sale.',
		example: 'Started with 50 iPhone cases, sold 27, so current stock is 23.',
		category: 'Inventory'
	},

	// Operations Terms
	{
		term: 'Transaction',
		definition: 'A complete sale that can contain multiple different products. Includes customer information, taxes, discounts, and multiple line items.',

		example: 'Old sales records that contained only one product per sale transaction.',
		category: 'Operations'
	},

	// Calculation Terms
	{
		term: 'Weighted Average Cost (WAC)',
		definition: 'The average cost per unit for all items in a shipment, calculated by dividing the total shipment cost by the number of units received.',
		example: '$1,000 shipment with 100 items = $10 WAC per item.',
		formula: 'WAC = Total Shipment Cost Ã· Total Units Received',
		category: 'Calculations'
	},
	{
		term: 'Line Total',
		definition: 'The total price for a specific product line within a transaction, calculated by multiplying quantity by price per item.',

		category: 'Calculations'
	},
	{
